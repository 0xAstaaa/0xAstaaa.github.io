I dive into code and capture the flag challenges to sharpen real-world skills. Most of my work revolves around web exploitation and boot2root machines — from quick scripts to full writeups.

You’ll also find projects around automation and Discord bots, where I explore how code can simplify everyday workflows.

Highlights:
- Focused CTF writeups with clear breakdowns and payloads  
- Clean, category-driven layout for easier navigation  
- Automated project listings fetched directly from GitHub  
- Social and Discord automation experiments showcased with code snippets
