I explore offensive security to build stronger systems. You’ll find my hands-on writeups and a curated list of projects here.

Highlights:
- Config-driven categories and clean layouts
- Client-side search with highlighting and filters
- Polished tag cloud with improved styling and colors
- Projects auto-fetched from GitHub, excluding forks and self-named repos
